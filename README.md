# Topic-modelling
Topic model for AWS cloud twitter conversation

The R script is a continuation from the sentiment analysis script in my other repository. Here I have extracted the tweets from twitter via the API and performed pre-processing steps such as de-duplication of tweets so such steps are not repeated here. The code could do with some more comments to explain and I will update it over the next couple of weeks
